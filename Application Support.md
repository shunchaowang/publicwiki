    * [X] Lei Wang requested to install `Open Systems Pharmacology Suite` on OSUWMC desktop/laptops
        On MC laptop/desktop running windows using AD authentication, 
        the better way to request the administrator permission is to call OSUWMC Help Desk @(614)293-3861, 
        they will ask for your MC login ID and usually provide you a few hours window with administrator privilege on your machine,
        you should be able to install the software you need during that time.
