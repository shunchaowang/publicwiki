## Sorting
There are 3 major sorting alogrithms to master and widely used in real world, they are insertion sorting, heap sorting,
and quick sorting. Even though insertion sorting has a O(n^2) complexicity, but it provides O(n) performance to insert a
new item into a already sorted array, which is the most case of real world. Both heap sorting and quick sorting have an
expected O(nlgn) complixicity, which are the most efficient sorting right now. All 3 are in place sorting.
